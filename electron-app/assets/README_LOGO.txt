To use the new logo as your application icon:

1. You need to convert the `logo.svg` file to an `.ico` file.
2. You can use an online converter like https://convertio.co/svg-ico/ or https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-ico.
3. Once you have the `logo.ico` file, rename it to `app-icon.ico`.
4. Replace the existing `app-icon.ico` in the `electron-app` folder with your new file.
5. Rebuild the application using `npm run package` in the `electron-app` directory.
